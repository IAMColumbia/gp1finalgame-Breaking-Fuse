Game Name: Unstoppable

Description Short: 

	A game about surviving for as long as you can by prioritizing defense. The player also collects coins and defends themselves from enemy attacks for bonus points.

Description Long: 

	In this Endless-Runner Action game, the player runs through an endless tunnel where they must prioritize Defending themselves, trying to get their score up as high as possible. The score is based on the coins they collect along the way, how long the player survives, and successful projectile-guarding. Enemies are randomized and so are obstacles in the path â€“ including holes and the paths that coins spawn in. Defense is a priority. When the player gets hit, they will immediately lose. They will be told their score and will be able to try again for a better score.
