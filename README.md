Game Name: Unstoppable

Description Short: 

	A game about surviving for as long as you can by prioritizing defense. The player also collects coins and fights back at enemies for bonus points along the way.

Description Long: 

	In this Endless-Runner Action game, the player runs through an endless tunnel where they must prioritize Defending themselves, trying to get their score up as high as possible. The score is based on the coins they collect along the way and how far they go. Enemies are procedurally generated and so are obstacles in the path â€“ including holes, objects, and the paths required to get all coins possible. Though defense is priority, the player can attack as well. They will be able to perform a forward-thrust to attack an enemy standing directly in front of them or a massive swing over their left or right shoulder. The latter ability will be able to fend off attackers that have come from behind the player. When the player gets hit, they will immediately lose. They will be told their score and will be able to try again for a better score.
