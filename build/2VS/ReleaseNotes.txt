Release Notes version 2 Vertical Slice

It is very simple for the first few tiles. This is where Instructions will show on screen before enemies do.

The first couple of "Level Tiles" in the runner are now basic and empty of any enemies and holes in the floor.
There is an issue with some of the tiles not being instantiated exactly where they need to be, stopping the
level tiles from connecting Seamlessly.

The level geometry of each Level Tile alternates between two basic designs:
 - Portion of ground to walk on (Two Holes with the ground forced to the left/right)
 - Whole tile is filled with a floor

Much of this was wasted to overhaul the Ground/Obstacle system.

If the player walks into the black areas(obstacles), they will die (currently closes the application).
